PHP CodeIgniterFramework
-------------------------
    "CodeIgniter is a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint, 
    built for PHP coders who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create 
    full-featured web applications. If you're a developer who lives in the 
    real world of shared hosting accounts and clients with deadlines, and 
    if you're tired of ponderously large and thoroughly undocumented 
    frameworks"

JpGraph
--------
    "JpGraph is a Object-Oriented Graph creating library for PHP >= 4.3.1 The 
    library is completely written in PHP and ready to be used in any PHP 
    scripts (both CGI/APXS/CLI versions of PHP are supported).

    The library can be used to create numerous types of graphs either on-line 
    or written to a file. JpGraph makes it easy to draw both "quick and dirty" 
    graphs with a minimum of code as well as complex graphs which requires a 
    very fine grained control. The library assigns context sensitive default 
    values for most of the parameters which minimizes the learning curve. The 
    features are there when you need them - not as an obstacle to overcome!"

Tango Desktop Project
----------------------    
    "The Tango Desktop Project exists to help create a consistent graphical 
    user interface experience for free and Open Source software."
    
    Manaweb uses some icons of this project as long as mana has not its own set
    of icons. (some of them got recoloured to match the style of manaweb)

script.aculo.us
---------------

    "The Web is changing. The 30-year-old terminal-like technology it was
    originally is gradually giving way to new ways of doing things. The power
    of AJAX allows for rich user interaction without the trouble that has
    bugged traditional web applications.

    Building upon the wonderful Prototype JavaScript library, script.aculo.us
    provides you with some great additional ingredients to mix in."
